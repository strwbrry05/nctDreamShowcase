## About the Project
### Nav + Footer
Interesting feature about the nav is that at the start, it remains one color but once you scroll, it turns black and sticks to the top of the window. This was inspired by the Netflix nav which acts in a somewhat similar way.

<br/>
Both of the footers look identical in both the night and day version. This makes the page as a whole feel more professional and mature.

### Hero
The hero contains an image of all of the group members. On load, each member cut out pops up indicating to the user that they are interactable. If a user selects a member, the page will redirect you to that members' information section. This feature only works on screens larger than mobile.

### Member Information
Below are member information sections from both day version and night version. Each is built with a member image, a slideshow of related images, their name, birthday, star sign, blood type, and a short description of that member. As a fun feature, when scrolling down the page for the first time, the member images slide in to frame.

### Albums
An infinite carousel of all of the groups music. When hovered over, the carousel pauses. Once the mouse leaves the section, the carousel begins again.

### Socials
An innovative way to link socials. Photocards are popular with kpop groups and I wanted to be able to incorporate them on the website. In order to do that I made them draggable and obstructing their socials. In that way, the user will have to interact with the photocards to get to their goal (socials). Feature only works on screens larger than mobile.
